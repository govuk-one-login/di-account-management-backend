# Powertools for AWS Lambda (TypeScript) <!-- omit in toc -->

Powertools for AWS Lambda (TypeScript) is a developer toolkit to implement Serverless [best practices and increase developer velocity](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda-typescript/latest/#features).

You can use the library in both TypeScript and JavaScript code bases.

> Also available in [Python](https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda-python), [Java](https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda-java), and [.NET](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda-dotnet/).

## Features

* **[Tracer](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda-typescript/latest/core/tracer/)** - Utilities to trace Lambda function handlers, and both synchronous and asynchronous functions
* **[Logger](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda-typescript/latest/core/logger/)** - Structured logging made easier, and a middleware to enrich log items with key details of the Lambda context
* **[Metrics](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda-typescript/latest/core/metrics/)** - Custom Metrics created asynchronously via CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format (EMF)
* **[Parameters](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda-typescript/latest/utilities/parameters/)** - High-level functions to retrieve one or more parameters from AWS SSM, Secrets Manager, AppConfig, and DynamoDB

## Getting started

Find the complete project's [documentation here](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda-typescript).

### Installation

The Powertools for AWS Lambda (TypeScript) utilities follow a modular approach, similar to the official [AWS SDK v3 for JavaScript](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3).  

Each TypeScript utility is installed as standalone npm package.

Install all three core utilities at once with this single command:

```shell
npm install @aws-lambda-powertools/logger @aws-lambda-powertools/tracer @aws-lambda-powertools/metrics
```

Or refer to the installation guide of each utility:

ðŸ‘‰ [Installation guide for the **Tracer** utility](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda-typescript/latest/core/tracer#getting-started)

ðŸ‘‰ [Installation guide for the **Logger** utility](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda-typescript/latest/core/logger#getting-started)

ðŸ‘‰ [Installation guide for the **Metrics** utility](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda-typescript/latest/core/metrics#getting-started)

ðŸ‘‰ [Installation guide for the **Parameters** utility](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda-typescript/latest/utilities/parameters/#getting-started)

### Using Lambda Layer

This helps us understand who uses Powertools for AWS Lambda (TypeScript) in a non-intrusive way, and helps us gain future investments for other Powertools for AWS Lambda languages. When [using Layers](#lambda-layers), you can add Powertools for AWS Lambda (TypeScript) as a dev dependency (or as part of your virtual env) to not impact the development process.
